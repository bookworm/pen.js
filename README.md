More Details soon. Barely a prototype at the moment, _Do NOT USE_. 

Thanks to [CodeMirror2](http://codemirror.net) without which I wouldn't have been able to build this.    

# Known issues/TODOS

1. Cursor position does not adjust vertically.
2. Need to add support for nesting elements like lists etc.       
3. Needs a real demo.
